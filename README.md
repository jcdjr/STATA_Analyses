# STATA_Analyses

##Catalogue Description and Objectives
This course is a survey of and practicum in the basic techniques of quantitative research,
including measurement, data description, hypothesis testing, and the use of appropriate statistical
techniques. This hands-on course uses STATA, a software package of standard statistical
methods, to help you analyze data and report findings. Although the course involves some math,
it focuses on the practical applications of those statistical methods that you will find commonly
used in the social and physical sciences. Students will undertake practical book and computer
exercises that require critical thinking and analytical skills. The course covers a variety of topics
in quantitative methods, including the identification and development of concepts; formulation of
hypotheses and specification of corresponding models; use of descriptive statistics including
graphs and cross tabulation; techniques of sampling and corresponding logics of inference;
measurement of associations and tests of significance; and bivariate, multivariate, and logistic
regression. When the student has completed the course, he or she will possess (a) a working
knowledge of basic statistical techniques in social and physical sciences; (b) the knowledge to
read, comprehend and criticize existing studies that utilize these techniques; and (c) the skills to
apply these statistical techniques, in conjunction with STATA, to test hypotheses as part of a
comprehensive research design.

##Prerequisites
The course assumes students possess a basic understanding of descriptive statistics and the
fundamentals of research design, as elaborated in Statistics 130M: Elementary Statistics and
Political Science/Geography 308: Research Design. Both courses are pre-requisites for this
course. If you have not successfully completed both courses you will not be allowed to take
POLS/GEO 418
